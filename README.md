# drposter: Generate Academic Posters in R Markdown and CSS

This fork is adapted for [WASP](http://wasp-sweden.org).

![poster](poster-0.png)

## Overview

* Template for writing HTML/CSS posters using Rmarkdown
* Same conventions as pandoc presentations
  (e.g. reveal.js)
* Separates content from presentation
* Goal: automatically get consistent spacing from specifications
  instead of a manual layout

## Rmarkdown structure

See the [source
code](https://github.com/martisak/drposter/tree/master/inst/example/poster.Rmd)
and [compiled
pdf](https://github.com/martisak/drposter/tree/master/inst/example/poster.pdf)
for this poster on Github.

</div>

    ---
    title: Title of your document within R Markdown's YAML header
    output: drposter::drposter_poster
    ---
    
    # {.col-3}
    ## Overall document columns (`<h1>`)
    
    Content is organized using headers as sections.  Level 1 sections
    define the overall layout of subblocks.  Use the `.col-x` class to
    use x columns for subblocks.
    
    ## Another left column block
    
    You can place multiple subblocks within the same overall .col-x,
    for example to get a 3-column layout like this example code here.
    
    # {.col-3}
    ## Individual content blocks (`<h2>`)
    
    Actual content goes within the level 2 blocks, which have two inner
    columns by default, e.g. for figures.
    
    ![](path_to_figure.jpg)
    
    Most of the markdown commands seem to work, though there are
    probably still some that are untested.
    
    # {.col-3}
    ## Use this div to automatically write your references to a section:
    
    <div id="refs" class="references"></div>

## How to use this package

### Installation and updates

1.  `devtools::install_github("bbucior/drposter", dep=FALSE)` (or
    `install_local` on a downloaded copy) to install/update the package
2.  In RStudio, you can find the format listed as a template under the
    “New R Markdown” wizard, or use the command line.
3.  Template files are cached in `drposter_files/` to decouple your
    poster from the installed package version. Use `drposter_update` to
    resync them.

### Customizing the template

  - Avoid modifying `drposter_files/`
  - Indirectly override those rules in your own `custom.css` or
    equivalent
      - Easier to see and share your changes
      - Decouples your modifications from the base drposter styles
  - Customize the format of the bibliography<sup>5,6</sup> using a CSL
    style<sup>4</sup>

### Export

  - View and “print as PDF” from Chrome<sup>7</sup>
    <!-- Note: the footnote used to be a bibtex "note," but the default ACS template doesn't include that field -->
  - Be sure to save a PDF (and possibly html with `self_contained:
    true`) to archive your project at the end, in case there are changes
    in pandoc, rmarkdown, etc.
  - You can also render the poster in other formats, such as a
    `github_document` or `revealjs::revealjs_presentation`

## Reproducible research

### Directly include plots

## Customizable themes

Note the features for theming. If you had a special class attached to
the .level1 or .slides/theme, you could use a general descendent
selector to automatically get theming support, then break up these
details into separate theme files.

## Default theme

This is an example of the default theme.

## Minimalist theme
